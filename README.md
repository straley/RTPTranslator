Translates RTP.PT CCs

For those who watch rtp.pt/play and struggle with understanding, I wrote a small program that will translate the programs that have CC subtitles (very few do, sadly) and replace the Portuguese subtitles with Portuguese + English subtitles.
A few caveats:
- You'll need to watch a program that has the CC button displayed on the screen 
- You need to know how to open the "console" in Chrome
- You need to get a free developer API key from DeepL (https://www.deepl.com/pro/change-plan#developer)
- This will likely break if the RTP site is ever changed
- You can only translate 500,000 characters per month on the free account.  It's your responsibility to make sure this is working properly.  I'm not responsible for defects that might cause you to use up your limit too quickly.
You can see an example of how this works at https://www.loom.com/share/cf9f547c9592458188cf11a392802275
